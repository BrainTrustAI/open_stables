This is the repository of the Stable Dock platform. Stable Dock is
Apache-2.0 licensed code for running **Stable Diffusion** based applications
**on Docker.** 

The main goal is to enable folks to easily use Stable Diffusion inside
their own private cloud accounts. For example AWS rents out A10G GPUs
with 24 GB of VRAM, for about one dollar per hour. That is a spiffy
GPU for running Stable Diffusion. With Stable Dock there is no need to
purchase a GPU.

**Initial releases** of Stable Dock are **targeted specifically for
AWS.** The long term goal is to have Stable Dock run well on all the
major cloud providers, as well as stock Kubernetes on private metal
data centers.


Specific applications packaged to run atop Stable Dock are
[hosted in separate repositories](https://github.com/orgs/BrainTrustAI/repositories).
