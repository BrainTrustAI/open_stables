This is the repository of the Stable Dock platform. Stable Dock is
Apache-2.0 licensed code for running Stable Diffusion based applications
on Docker. Initial release are targeted specifically for AWS, although
the long term goal is to have Stable Dock run well on all the major
cloud providers, as well as stock Kubernetes on private metal data centers.


Specific applications packaged to run atop Stable Dock are
[hosted in separate repositories](https://github.com/orgs/BrainTrustAI/repositories).

For more information, see [the wiki](https://github.com/BrainTrustAI/stable_dock/wiki).
